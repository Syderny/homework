## 1、Program with machine language according to the following c. 
```c
int_8 a = 1;
int_8 c = a + 3;
```
### 1）Write your assembly code & machine code

```armasm
LDA 0x0001,i
STA 0x0000,d
LDA 0x0003,i
ADDA 0x0000,d
STA 0x0002,d
.END
```
```
C0 00 01 E1 00 00 C0 00 03 71 00 00 E1 00 02 zz
```

### 2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle

Machine code is a computer program written in machine language instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory.

### 3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU 

**IR**

In computing, an **instruction register** (IR) is the part of a CPU's control unit that holds the instruction currently being executed or decoded. In simple processors each instruction to be executed is loaded into the instruction register which holds it while it is decoded, prepared and ultimately executed, which can take several steps.

**PC**

The **program counter** (PC), commonly called the instruction pointer (IP) in Intel x86 and Itanium microprocessors, and sometimes called the instruction address register (IAR), the instruction counter, or just part of the instruction sequencer, is a processor register that indicates where a computer is in its program sequence.

**ACC**

In a computer's central processing unit (CPU), an **accumulator** is a register in which intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored.

Without a register like an accumulator, it would be necessary to write the result of each calculation (addition, multiplication, shift, etc.) to main memory, perhaps only to be read right back again for use in the next operation. Access to main memory is slower than access to a register like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower (but cheaper) than that used for a register. Early electronic computer systems were often split into two groups, those with accumulators and those without.

### 4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine 
Operands which are stored in RAM.

## 2、简答题 
### 1）What are stored in memory?

Instructions and Operands.

### 2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place? 
No, it can't.
### 3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions. 
The PIPPIN assembly language is a simple language for programming a simple machine which has 256 bytes of memory, labelled byte 0 to byte 255. These bytes are divided into three categories:

**Instructions (opcodes**)<br>
**Operands**<br>
**Variables (data)**

The first 128 bytes are used for the "program space" of a PIPPIN program. These are where the statements for the programs we write will be found. Each statement requires two bytes. The first byte is for the actual instruction to be performed, for example ADD. Note that each instruction is represented by an 8-bit (1-byte) opcode. This means that the PIPPIN machine can have up to 256 different instructions. In reality, the machine has far fewer, but the choice of 1-byte opcodes allows that many. The second byte describes an operand which the instruction will need to perform its task, for example "add what?" In PIPPIN, the operand will either be an actual value (like 42) or it will be an address for a memory location in the "variable space" of the machine (like the location of variable X). 

The next 128 bytes are reserved for the "variable space" which will be used by the program to hold all of its data. All of the values to be processed will be stored in these locations, which can be referred to by names.


## 3、解释以下词汇 
### 1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）
An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

### 2）编译（Compiler） 
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.[1] A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

### 3）命令式语言（Imperative programming） 
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

### 4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.

### 5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC.[1] Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.
